# Smart-Watch-Project
✔Track location, send warning message, collect and update your temperature and pulse to THINGSPEAK.
✔This  project is based on AVR microcontroller.

# What can this project do?
✔  Get and display your body tempurature with pulse to LCD1602. Morever, it can send that tracking data to THINGSPEAK for drawing graph. 
This really help you for cheking your health 💪🏻💪🏻💪🏻
✔  Are you in quaratine😷? Remember to track your location with our project. So far from home🏠? A message with location to your family or friend will announce them! 📢📢📢

#  What items need to be prepared for this project?
> Atmega8 and atmega16, very cheap and popular items in microcontroller world.
> GPS neo 6M module, tracking your location with satelite, easily in use.
> Module SIM 800L, support gprs and calling, sending messeage.
> MLX90614, a tempurature sensor that gives you very exactly value of body temp.
> Pulse Sensor, simple and basic for tracking your pulse.
> Two power supply with 5V and 4.2V.
> Don't forget USB-ASP for uploading your code to microchip.
> Some capacitor for removal noise from power supply.
> Some resistor, and a large amount of wires, of course!!!

# What software need to be prepared for this project?
> An ide for Atmel Microchip, i used Atmel Studio for this project.
> An upload software. In my cases, i used progisp.
> May be some simulation will help you alot, Proteus was my choice.
